<h1>THE HUNTERS</h1>

<p class="center" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 120%; letter-spacing: 0.15em;">BY WILLIAM MORRISON</p>

<p class="center">ILLUSTRATED BY VAN DONGEN</p>

<p class="blurb">To all who didn't know him, Curt George was a
mighty hunter and actor. But this time he was
up against others who could really act, and
whose business was the hunting of whole worlds.</p>


<p>There were thirty or more of
the little girls, their ages ranging
apparently from nine to
eleven, all of them chirping
away like a flock of chicks as
they followed the old mother hen
past the line of cages. "Now,
now, girls," called Miss Burton
cheerily. "Don't scatter. I can't
keep my eye on you if you get
too far away from me. You,
Hilda, give me that water pistol.
No, don't fill it up first at that
fountain. And Frances, stop
bouncing your ball. You'll lose it
through the bars, and a polar
bear may get it and not want to
give it back."</p>

<p>Frances giggled. "Oh, Miss
Burton, do you think the polar
bear would want to play catch?"</p>

<p>The two men who were looking
on wore pleased smiles.
"Charming," said Manto. "But
somewhat unpredictable, despite
all our experiences, <em lang="es" xml:lang="es">muy amigo</em>."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/hunters.png" width="406" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"No attempts at Spanish, Manto,
not here. It calls attention to
us. And you are not sure of the
grammar anyway. You may find
yourself saying things you do
not intend."</p>

<p>"Sorry, Palit. It wasn't an attempt
to show my skill, I assure
you. It's that by now I have a
tendency to confuse one language
with another."</p>

<p>"I know. You were never a linguist.
But about these interesting
creatures&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suggest that they could
stand investigation. It would be
good to know how they think."</p>

<p>"Whatever you say, Manto. If
you wish, we shall join the little
ladies."</p>

<p>"We must have our story prepared
first."</p>

<p>Palit nodded, and the two men
stepped under the shade of a
tree whose long, drooping, leaf-covered
branches formed a convenient
screen. For a moment,
the tree hid silence. Then there
came from beneath the branches
the chatter of girlish voices, and
two little girls skipped merrily
away. Miss Burton did not at
first notice that now she had an
additional two children in her
charge.</p>

<p>"Do you think you will be able
to keep your English straight?"
asked one of the new little girls.</p>

<p>The other one smiled with
amusement and at first did not
answer. Then she began to skip
around her companion and
chant, "I know a secret, I know
a secret."</p>

<p>There was no better way to
make herself inconspicuous. For
some time, Miss Burton did not
notice her.</p>

<hr/>
<div class="spacing"></div>

<p>The polar bears, the grizzlies,
the penguins, the reptiles, all
were left behind. At times the
children scattered, but Miss Burton
knew how to get them together
again, and not one was
lost.</p>

<p>"Here, children, is the building
where the kangaroos live.
Who knows where kangaroos
come from?"</p>

<p>"Australia!" clanged the shrill
chorus.</p>

<p>"That's right. And what other
animals come from Australia?"</p>

<p>"I know, Miss Burton!" cried
Frances, a dark-haired nine-year-old
with a pair of glittering
eyes that stared like a pair
of critics from a small heart-shaped
face. "I've been here before.
Wallabies and wombats!"</p>

<p>"Very good, Frances."</p>

<p>Frances smirked at the approbation.
"I've been to the zoo
lots of times," she said to the
girl next to her. "My father
takes me."</p>

<p>"I wish my father would take
me too," replied the other little
girl, with an air of wistfulness.</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask him to?"
Before the other little girl could
answer, Frances paused, cocked
her head slightly, and demanded,
"Who are you? You aren't in our
class."</p>

<p>"I'm in Miss Hassel's class."</p>

<p>"Miss Hassel? Who is she? Is
she in our school?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the other
little girl uncertainly. "I go to
P.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;77&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Burton," screamed
Frances. "Here's a girl who isn't
in our class! She got lost from
her own class!"</p>

<hr/>
<div class="spacing"></div>

<p>"Really?" Miss Burton seemed
rather pleased at the idea that
some other teacher had been so
careless as to lose one of her
charges. "What's your name,
child?"</p>

<p>"I'm Carolyn."</p>

<p>"Carolyn what?"</p>

<p>"Carolyn Manto. Please, Miss
Burton, I had to go to the bathroom,
and then when I came
out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know."</p>

<p>A shrill cry came from another
section of her class. "Oh, Miss
Burton, here's another one who's
lost!"</p>

<p>The other little girl was
pushed forward. "Now, who are
<em>you</em>?" Miss Burton asked.</p>

<p>"I'm Doris Palit. I went with
Carolyn to the bathroom&mdash;"</p>

<hr/>
<div class="spacing"></div>

<p>Miss Burton made a sound of
annoyance. Imagine losing <em>two</em>
children and not noticing it right
away. The other teacher must
be frantic by now, and serve her
right for being so careless.</p>

<p>"All right, you may stay with
us until we find a policeman&mdash;"
She interrupted herself. "Frances,
what are you giggling at
now?"</p>

<p>"It's Carolyn. She's making
faces just like you!"</p>

<p>"Really, Carolyn, that isn't at
all nice!"</p>

<p>Carolyn's face altered itself in
a hurry, so as to lose any resemblance
to Miss Burton's. "I'm
sorry, Miss Burton, I didn't
really mean to do anything
wrong."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to know how
you were brought up, if you
don't know that it's wrong to
mimic people to their faces. A
big girl like you, too. How old
are you, Carolyn?"</p>

<p>Carolyn shrank, she hoped imperceptibly,
by an inch. "I'm
two&mdash;"</p>

<p>An outburst of shrill laughter.
"She's two years old, she's
two years old!"</p>

<p>"I was going to say, I'm
<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><em>to</em>welve</span>. Almost, anyway."</p>

<p>"Eleven years old," said Miss
Burton. "Old enough to know
better."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Miss Burton. And
honest, Miss Burton, I didn't
mean anything, but I'm studying
to be an actress, and I imitate
people, like the actors you
see on television&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Burton, please don't
make her go home with a policeman.
If she's going to be an
actress, I'll bet she'd love to see
Curt George!"</p>

<p>"Well, after the way she's behaved,
I don't know whether I
should let her. I really don't."</p>

<p>"Please, Miss Burton, it was
an accident. I won't do it again."</p>

<p>"All right, if you're good, and
cause no trouble. But we still
have plenty of time before seeing
Mr. George. It's only two now,
and we're not supposed to go to
the lecture hall until four."</p>

<p>"Miss Burton," called Barbara
Willman, "do you think he'd give
us his autograph?"</p>

<p>"Now, children, I've warned
you about that. You mustn't
annoy him. Mr. George is a famous
movie actor, and his time
is valuable. It's very kind of him
to offer to speak to us, especially
when so many grown-up people
are anxious to hear him, but
we mustn't take advantage of his
kindness."</p>

<p>"But he likes children, Miss
Burton! My big sister read in a
movie magazine where it said
he's just crazy about them."</p>

<p>"I know, but&mdash;he's not in good
health, children. They say he got
jungle fever in Africa, where he
was shooting all those lions, and
rhinoceroses, and elephants for
his new picture. That's why you
mustn't bother him too much."</p>

<p>"But he looks so big and
strong, Miss Burton. It wouldn't
hurt him to sign an autograph!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it would," asserted
one little girl. "He shakes. When
he has an attack of fever, his
hand shakes."</p>

<p>"Yes, Africa is a dangerous
continent, and one never knows
how the dangers will strike one,"
said Miss Burton complacently.
"So we must all remember how
bravely Mr. George is fighting
his misfortune, and do our best
not to tire him out."</p>

<hr/>
<div class="spacing"></div>

<p>In the bright light that flooded
the afternoon breakfast table,
Curt George's handsome, manly
face wore an expression of distress.
He groaned dismally, and
muttered, "What a head I've got,
what a head. How do you expect
me to face that gang of kids
without a drink to pick me up?"</p>

<p>"You've had your drink," said
Carol. She was slim, attractive,
and efficient. At the moment she
was being more efficient than attractive,
and she could sense his
resentment. "That's all you get.
Now, lay off, and try to be
reasonably sober, for a change."</p>

<p>"But those kids! They'll squeal
and giggle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're about the only audience
in the world that won't
spot you as a drunk. God knows
where I could find any one else
who'd believe that your hand
shakes because of fever."</p>

<p>"I know that you're looking
out for my best interests, Carol.
But one more drink wouldn't
hurt me."</p>

<p>She said wearily, but firmly, "I
don't argue with drunks, Curt. I
just go ahead and protect them
from themselves. No drinks."</p>

<p>"Afterwards?"</p>

<p>"I can't watch you the way a
mother watches a child."</p>

<p>The contemptuous reply sent
his mind off on a new tack. "You
could if we were married."</p>

<p>"I've never believed in marrying
weak characters to reform
them."</p>

<p>"But if I proved to you that I
could change&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Prove it first, and I'll consider
your proposal afterwards."</p>

<p>"You certainly are a cold-blooded
creature, Carol. But I
suppose that in your profession
you have to be."</p>

<p>"Cold, suspicious, nasty&mdash;and
reliable. It's inevitable when I
must deal with such warm-hearted,
trusting, and unreliable
clients."</p>

<p>He watched her move about
the room, clearing away the
dishes from his meager breakfast.
"What are you humming,
Carol?"</p>

<p>"Was I humming?"</p>

<p>"I thought I recognized it&mdash;<q>All
of Me, Why Not Take All of
Me</q>? That's it! Your subconscious
gives you away. You really
want to marry me!"</p>

<p>"A mistake," she said coolly.
"My subconscious doesn't know
what it's talking about. All I
want of you is the usual ten per
cent."</p>

<p>"Can't you forget for a moment
that you're an agent, and
remember that you're a woman,
too?"</p>

<p>"No. Not unless you forget
that you're a drunk, and remember
that you're a man. Not unless
you make me forget that you
drank your way through
Africa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because you weren't there
with me!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;with hardly enough energy
to let them dress you in that
hunter's outfit and photograph
you as if you were shooting
lions."</p>

<p>"You're so unforgiving, Carol.
You don't have much use for me,
do you&mdash;consciously, that is?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, Curt, no. I don't
have much use for useless people."</p>

<p>"I'm not entirely useless. I
earn you that ten per cent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd gladly forego that to see
you sober."</p>

<p>"But it's your contempt for me
that drives me to drink. And
when I think of having to face
those dear little kiddies with
nothing inside me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There should be happiness inside
you at the thought of your
doing a good deed. Not a drop,
George, not a drop."</p>

<hr/>
<div class="spacing"></div>

<p>The two little girls drew apart
from the others and began to
whisper into each other's ears.
The whispers were punctuated
by giggles which made the entire
childish conversation seem quite
normal. But Palit was in no
laughing mood. He said, in his
own language, "You're getting
careless, Manto. You had no
business imitating her expression."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Palit, but it was
so suggestive. And I'm a very
suggestible person."</p>

<p>"So am I. But I control myself."</p>

<p>"Still, if the temptation were
great enough, I don't think you'd
be able to resist either."</p>

<p>"The issues are important
enough to make me resist."</p>

<p>"Still, I thought I saw your
own face taking on a bit of her
expression too."</p>

<p>"You are imagining things,
Manto. Another thing, that mistake
in starting to say you were
two hundred years old&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They would have thought it
a joke. And I think I got out of
that rather neatly."</p>

<p>"You like to skate on thin ice,
don't you, Manto? Just as you
did when you changed your
height. You had no business
shrinking right out in public like
that."</p>

<p>"I did it skillfully. Not a
single person noticed."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> noticed."</p>

<p>"Don't quibble."</p>

<p>"I don't intend to. Some of
these children have very sharp
eyes. You'd be surprised at what
they see."</p>

<p>Manto said tolerantly, "You're
getting jittery, Palit. We've
been away from home too long."</p>

<p>"I am not jittery in the least.
But I believe in taking due care."</p>

<p>"What could possibly happen
to us? If we were to announce
to the children and the teacher,
and to every one in this zoo, for
that matter, exactly who and
what we were, they wouldn't believe
us. And even if they did,
they wouldn't be able to act rapidly
enough to harm us."</p>

<p>"You never can tell about such
things. Wise&mdash;people&mdash;simply
don't take unnecessary chances."</p>

<p>"I'll grant that you're my superior
in such wisdom."</p>

<p>"You needn't be sarcastic,
Manto, I <em>know</em> I'm superior. <em>I</em>
realize what a godsend this
planet is&mdash;you don't. It has the
right gravity, a suitable atmosphere,
the proper chemical composition&mdash;everything."</p>

<p>"Including a population that
will be helpless before us."</p>

<p>"And you would take chances
of losing all this."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Palit. What
chances am I taking?"</p>

<p>"The chance of being discovered.
Here we stumble on this
place quite by accident. No one
at home knows about it, no one
so much as suspects that it exists.
We must get back and report&mdash;and
you do all sorts of silly
things which may reveal what
we are, and lead these people to
suspect their danger."</p>

<hr/>
<div class="spacing"></div>

<p>This time, Manto's giggle was
no longer mere camouflage, but
expressed to a certain degree
how he felt. "They cannot possibly
suspect. We have been all
over the world, we have taken
many forms and adapted ourselves
to many customs, and no
one has suspected. And even if
danger really threatened, it
would be easy to escape. I could
take the form of the school
teacher herself, of a policeman,
of any one in authority. However,
at present there is not the
slightest shadow of danger. So,
Palit, you had better stop being
fearful."</p>

<p>Palit said firmly, "Be careful,
and I won't be fearful. That's all
there is to it."</p>

<p>"I'll be careful. After all, I
shouldn't want us to lose these
children. They're so exactly the
kind we need. Look how inquiring
they are, how unafraid, how
quick to adapt to any circumstances&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Burton's voice said,
"Good gracious, children, what
language <em>are</em> you using? Greek?"</p>

<p>They had been speaking too
loud, they had been overheard.
Palit and Manto stared at each
other, and giggled coyly. Then,
after a second to think, Palit
said, "Onay, Issmay Urtonbay!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Frances shrilled triumphantly,
"It isn't Greek, Miss Burton, it's
Latin&mdash;Pig-Latin. She said,
'No, Miss Burton.'"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, what is Pig-Latin?"</p>

<p>"It's a kind of way of talking
where you talk kind of backwards.
Like, you don't say, <em>Me</em>,
you say, <em>Emay</em>."</p>

<p>"You don't say, <em>Yes</em>, you say
<em>Esyay</em>," added another little girl.</p>

<p>"You don't say, <em>You</em>, you say,
<em>Ouyay</em>. You don't say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, all right, I get the
idea."</p>

<p>"You don't say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That'll do," said Miss Burton
firmly. "Now, let's get along
to the lion house. And please,
children, do not make faces at
the lions. How would you like to
be in a cage and have people
make faces at you? Always remember
to be considerate to
others."</p>

<p>"Even lions, Miss Burton?"</p>

<p>"Even lions."</p>

<p>"But Mr. George shot lots of
lions. Was he considerate of them
too?"</p>

<p>"There is no time for silly
questions," said Miss Burton,
with the same firmness. "Come
along."</p>

<p>They all trouped after her,
Palit and Manto bringing up the
rear. Manto giggled, and whispered
with amusement, "That
Pig-Latin business was quick
thinking, Palit. But in fact, quite
unnecessary. The things that you
do to avoid being suspected!"</p>

<p>"It never hurts to take precautions.
And I think that now it is
time to leave."</p>

<p>"No, not yet. You are always
anxious to learn details before
reporting. Why not learn a few
more details now?"</p>

<p>"Because they are not necessary.
We already have a good
understanding of human customs
and psychology."</p>

<p>"But not of the psychology of
children. And they, if you remember,
are the ones who will
have to adapt. We shall be asked
about them. It would be nice if
we could report that they are fit
for all-purpose service, on a wide
range of planets. Let us stay
awhile longer."</p>

<p>"All right," conceded Palit,
grudgingly.</p>

<hr/>
<div class="spacing"></div>

<p>So they stayed, and out of
some twigs and leaves they
shaped the necessary coins with
which to buy peanuts, and popcorn,
and ice cream, and other
delicacies favored by the young.
Manto wanted to win easy popularity
by treating a few of the
other children, but Palit put his
girlish foot down. No use arousing
suspicion. Even as it was&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gee, your father gives you an
awful lot of spending money,"
said Frances enviously. "Is he
rich?"</p>

<p>"We get as much as we want,"
replied Manto carelessly.</p>

<p>"Gosh, I wish I did."</p>

<p>Miss Burton collected her
brood. "Come together, children,
I have something to say to you.
Soon it will be time to go in and
hear Mr. George. Now, if Mr.
George is so kind as to entertain
us, don't you think that it's only
proper for us to entertain him?"</p>

<p>"We could put on our class
play!" yelled Barbara.</p>

<p>"Barbara's a fine one to talk,"
said Frances. "She doesn't even
remember her lines."</p>

<p>"No, children, we mustn't do
anything we can't do well. That
wouldn't make a good impression.
And besides, there is no
time for a play. Perhaps Barbara
will sing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can sing a 'Thank You'
song," interrupted Frances.</p>

<p>"That would be nice."</p>

<p>"I can recite," added another
little girl.</p>

<p>"Fine. How about you, Carolyn?
You and your little friend,
Doris. Can she act too?"</p>

<p>Carolyn giggled. "Oh, yes, she
can act very well. I can act like
people. She can act like animals."
The laughing, girlish eyes evaded
a dirty look from the little
friend. "She can act like <em>any</em>
kind of animal."</p>

<p>"She's certainly a talented
child. But she seems so shy!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Carolyn. "She
likes to be coaxed."</p>

<p>"She shouldn't be like that.
Perhaps, Carolyn, you and Doris
can do something together. And
perhaps, too, Mr. George will be
pleased to see that your teacher
also has talent."</p>

<p>"You, Miss Burton?"</p>

<p>Miss Burton coughed modestly.
"Yes, children, I never told you,
but I was once ambitious to be
an actress too. I studied dramatics,
and really, I was quite
good at it. I was told that if I
persevered I might actually be
famous. Just think, your teacher
might actually have been a famous
actress! However, in my
day, there were many coarse people
on the stage, and the life of
the theater was not attractive&mdash;but
perhaps we'd better not
speak of that. At any rate, I
know the principles of the dramatic
art very well."</p>

<hr/>
<div class="spacing"></div>

<p>"God knows what I'll have to
go through," said Curt. "And I
don't see how I can take it
sober."</p>

<p>"I don't see how they can take
you drunk," replied Carol.</p>

<p>"Why go through with it at
all? Why not call the whole thing
quits?"</p>

<p>"Because people are depending
on you. You always want to call
quits whenever you run into
something you don't like. You
may as well call quits to your
contract if that's the way you
feel."</p>

<p>"And to your ten per cent,
darling."</p>

<p>"You think I'd mind that. I
work for my ten per cent, Curt,
sweetheart. I work too damn
hard for that ten per cent."</p>

<p>"You can marry me and take
it easy. Honest, Carol, if you
treated me better, if you showed
me I meant something to you,
I'd give up drinking."</p>

<p>She made a face. "Don't talk
nonsense. Take your outfit, and
let's get ready to go. Unless you
want to change here, and walk
around dressed as a lion hunter."</p>

<p>"Why not? I've walked around
dressed as worse. A drunk."</p>

<p>"Drunks don't attract attention.
They're too ordinary."</p>

<p>"But a drunken lion hunter&mdash;that's
something special." He
went into the next room and began
to change. "Carol," he
called. "Do you like me?"</p>

<p>"At times."</p>

<p>"Would you say that you liked
me very much?"</p>

<p>"When you're sober. Rarely."</p>

<p>"Love me?"</p>

<p>"Once in a blue moon."</p>

<p>"What would I have to do for
you to want to marry me?"</p>

<p>"Amount to something."</p>

<p>"I like that. Don't you think I
amount to something now?
Women swoon at the sight of my
face on the screen, and come to
life again at the sound of my
voice."</p>

<p>"The women who swoon at you
will swoon at anybody. Besides,
I don't consider that making nitwits
swoon is a useful occupation
for a real man."</p>

<p>"How can I be useful, Carol?
No one ever taught me how."</p>

<p>"Some people manage without
being taught."</p>

<p>"I suppose I could think how
if I had a drink inside me."</p>

<p>"Then you'll have to do without
thinking."</p>

<p>He came into the room again,
powerful, manly, determined-looking.
There was an expression
in his eye which indicated
courage without end, a courage
that would enable him to brave
the wrath of man, beast, or devil.</p>

<p>"How do I look?"</p>

<p>"Your noble self, of course. A
poor woman's edition of Rudolph
Valentino."</p>

<p>"I feel terrified. I don't know
how I'm going to face those kids.
If they were boys it wouldn't be
so bad, but a bunch of little
girls!"</p>

<p>"They'll grow up to be your
fans, if you're still alive five
years from now. Meanwhile, into
each life some rain must fall."</p>

<p>"You would talk of water,
when you know how I feel."</p>

<p>"Sorry. Come on, let's go."</p>

<hr/>
<div class="spacing"></div>

<p>The lecture hall resounded
with giggles. And beneath the
giggles was a steady undercurrent
of whispers, of girlish confidences
exchanged, of girlish
hopes that would now be fulfilled.
Miss Burton's class was
not the only one which had come
to hear the famous actor-hunter
describe his brave exploits. There
were at least five others like it,
and by some mistake, a class of
boys, who also whispered to each
other, in manly superiority, and
pretended to find amusement in
the presence of so many of the
fairer sex.</p>

<p>In this atmosphere of giggles
and whispers, Manto and Palit
could exchange confidences without
being noticed. Palit said savagely,
"Why did you tell her that
I could act too?"</p>

<p>"Why, because it's the truth.
You're a very good animal performer.
You make a wonderful
dragon, for instance. Go on,
Palit, show her what a fine
dragon you can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop it, you fool, before you
cause trouble!"</p>

<p>"Very well, Palit. Did I tempt
you?"</p>

<p>"Did you tempt me! You and
your sense of humor!"</p>

<p>"You and your lack of it! But
let's not argue now, Palit. Here,
I think, comes the lion-hunter.
Let's scream, and be as properly
excited as every one else is."</p>

<hr/>
<div class="spacing"></div>

<p>My God, he thought, how can
they keep their voices so high
so long? My eardrums hurt already.
How do they stand a lifetime
of it? Even an hour?</p>

<p>"Go ahead," whispered Carol.
"You've seen the script&mdash;go into
your act. Tell them what a hero
you are. You have the odds in
your favor to start with."</p>

<p>"My lovely looks," he said,
with some bitterness.</p>

<p>"Lovely is the word for you.
But forget that. If you're good&mdash;you'll
get a drink afterwards."</p>

<p>"Will it be one of those occasions
when you love me?"</p>

<p>"If the moon turns blue."</p>

<p>He strode to the front of the
platform, an elephant gun swinging
easily at his side, an easy
grin radiating from his confident,
rugged face. The cheers
rose to a shrill fortissimo, but
the grin did not vanish. What a
great actor he really was, he told
himself, to be able to pretend he
liked this.</p>

<p>An assistant curator of some
collection in the zoo, a flustered
old woman, was introducing him.
There were a few laudatory references
to his great talents as an
actor, and he managed to look
properly modest as he listened.
The remarks about his knowledge
of wild and ferocious beasts
were a little harder to take, but
he took them. Then the old
woman stepped back, and he was
facing his fate alone.</p>

<p>"Children," he began. A pause,
a bashful grin. "Perhaps I
should rather say, my friends.
I'm not one to think of you as
children. Some people think of
me as a child myself, because I
like to hunt, and have adventures.
They think that such
things are childish. But if they
are, I'm glad to be a child. I'm
glad to be one of you. Yes, I
think I <em>will</em> call you my friends.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you regard me, my
friends, as a very lucky person.
But when I recall some of the
narrow escapes I have had, I
don't agree with you. I remember
once, when we were on the
trail of a rogue elephant&mdash;"</p>

<p>He told the story of the rogue
elephant, modestly granting a co-hero's
role to his guide. Then
another story illustrating the
strange ways of lions. The elephant
gun figured in still another
tale, this time of a vicious
rhinoceros. His audience was
quiet now, breathless with interest,
and he welcomed the respite
from shrillness he had won
for his ears.</p>

<p>"And now, my friends, it is
time to say farewell." He actually
looked sad and regretful.
"But it is my hope that I shall
be able to see you again&mdash;"</p>

<p>Screams of exultation, shrill
as ever, small hands beating
enthusiastically to indicate joy.
Thank God that's over with, he
thought. Now for those drinks&mdash;and
he didn't mean drink,
singular. Talk of being useful,
he'd certainly been useful now.
He'd made those kids happy.
What more can any reasonable
person want?</p>

<hr/>
<div class="spacing"></div>

<p>But it wasn't over with. Another
old lady had stepped up on
the platform.</p>

<p>"Mr. George," she said, in a
strangely affected voice, like that
of the first dramatic teacher he
had ever had, the one who had
almost ruined his acting career.
"Mr. George, I can't tell you
how happy you have made us all,
young and old. Hasn't Mr.
George made us happy, children?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Burton!" came the
shrill scream.</p>

<p>"And we feel that it would be
no more than fair to repay you
in some small measure for the
pleasure you have given us.
First, a 'Thank You' song by
Frances Heller&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hadn't expected this, and
he repressed a groan. Mercifully,
the first song was short.
He grinned the thanks he didn't
feel. To think that he could take
this, while sober as a judge!
What strength of character,
what will-power!</p>

<p>Next, Miss Burton introduced
another kid, who recited. And
then, Miss Burton stood upright
and recited herself.</p>

<p>That was the worst of all. He
winced once, then bore up. You
can get used even to torture, he
told himself. An adult making a
fool of herself is always more
painful than a kid. And that
affected elocutionist's voice gave
him the horrors. But he thanked
her too. His good deed for the
day. Maybe Carol would have
him now, he thought.</p>

<p>A voice shrilled, "Miss Burton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear?"</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to call on
Carolyn to act?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I was forgetting.
Come up here, Carolyn, come up,
Doris. Carolyn and Doris, Mr.
George, are studying how to act.
They act people <em>and</em> animals.
Who knows? Some day they, too,
may be in the movies, just as you
are, Mr. George. Wouldn't that
be nice, children?"</p>

<p>What the devil do you do in a
case like that? You grin, of
course&mdash;but what do you say,
without handing over your soul
to the devil? Agree how nice it
would be to have those sly little
brats with faces magnified on
every screen all over the country?
Like hell you do.</p>

<p>"Now, what are we going to
act, children?"</p>

<p>"Please, Miss Burton," said
Doris. "I don't know how to act.
I can't even imitate a puppy.
Really I can't, Miss Burton&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come, come, mustn't be shy.
Your friend says that you act
very nicely indeed. Can't want to
go on the stage and still be shy.
Now, do you know any movie
scenes? Shirley Temple used to
be a good little actress, I remember.
Can you do any scenes that
she does?"</p>

<hr/>
<div class="spacing"></div>

<p>The silence was getting to be
embarrassing. And Carol said he
didn't amount to anything, he
never did anything useful. Why,
if thanks to his being here this
afternoon, those kids lost the
ambition to go on the stage, the
whole human race would have
cause to be grateful to him. To
him, and to Miss Burton. She'd
kill ambition in anybody.</p>

<p>Miss Burton had an idea. "I
know what to do, children. If
you can act animals&mdash;Mr. George
has shown you what the hunter
does; you show him what the
lions do. Yes, Carolyn and Doris,
you're going to be lions. You are
waiting in your lairs, ready to
pounce on the unwary hunter.
Crouch now, behind that chair.
Closer and closer he comes&mdash;you
act it out, Mr. George, please,
that's the way&mdash;ever closer, and
now your muscles tighten for
the spring, and you open
your great, wide, red mouths
in a great, great big roar&mdash;"</p>

<p>A deep and tremendous roar,
as of thunder, crashed through
the auditorium. A roar&mdash;and
then, from the audience, an outburst
of terrified screaming such
as he had never heard. The
bristles rose at the back of his
neck, and his heart froze.</p>

<p>Facing him across the platform
were two lions, tensed as
if to leap. Where they had come
from he didn't know, but there
they were, eyes glaring, manes
ruffled, more terrifying than any
he had seen in Africa. There
they were, with the threat of
death and destruction in their
fierce eyes, and here he was,
terror and helplessness on his
handsome, manly, and bloodless
face, heart unfrozen now and
pounding fiercely, knees melting,
hands&mdash;</p>

<p>Hands clutching an elephant
gun. The thought was like a director's
command. With calm efficiency,
with all the precision of
an actor playing a scene rehearsed
a thousand times, the
gun leaped to his shoulder, and
now its own roar thundered out
a challenge to the roaring of the
wild beasts, shouted at them in
its own accents of barking
thunder.</p>

<p>The shrill screaming continued
long after the echoes of the gun's
speech had died away. Across
the platform from him were two
great bodies, the bodies of lions,
and yet curiously unlike the
beasts in some ways, now that
they were dead and dissolving as
if corroded by some invisible
acid.</p>

<p>Carol's hand was on his arm,
Carol's thin and breathless voice
shook as she said, "A drink&mdash;all
the drinks you want."</p>

<p>"One will do. And you."</p>

<p>"And me. I guess you're kind
of&mdash;kind of useful after all."</p>
